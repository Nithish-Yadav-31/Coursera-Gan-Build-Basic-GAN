About
This Repository consists of answers to all weeks of the course on "Build basic GANs" from Deeplearning.ai offered by Coursera.
There are three courses offered by deeplearning.ai on GAN's

Week 1:
See some real-world applications of GANs, learn about their fundamental components, and build your very own GAN using PyTorch!

Week 2:
Learn about different activation functions, batch normalization, and transposed convolutions to tune your GAN architecture and apply them to build an advanced DCGAN specifically for processing images!

Learning Objectives:
Be able to explain the components of a Deep Convolutional GAN.
Compose a Deep Convolutional GAN using these components.
Examine the difference between upsampling and transposed convolutions.

Week 3:
Learn advanced techniques to reduce instances of GAN failure due to imbalances between the generator and discriminator! Implement a WGAN to mitigate unstable training and mode collapse using W-Loss and Lipschitz Continuity enforcement.

Learning Objectives:
Examine the cause and effect of an issue in GAN training known as mode collapse.
Implement a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty to remedy mode collapse.
Understand the motivation and condition needed for Wasserstein-Loss.

Week 4:
Understand how to effectively control your GAN, modify the features in a generated image, and build conditional GANs capable of generating examples from determined categories!

Learning Objectives:
Control GAN generated outputs by adding conditional inputs.
Control GAN generated outputs by manipulating z-vectors.
Be able to explain disentanglement in a GAN.
